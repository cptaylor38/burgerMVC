# [Burger Bazaar](https://burger-bazaar.herokuapp.com/)

Overview
    Small Handlebars/MySQL application that allows you to add the name of a burger, and whether you've tried it, then adds it to the appropriate column. In each column you can toggle whether you have tried the burger listed or wish to add it back to the list of burgers you would like to try again.
